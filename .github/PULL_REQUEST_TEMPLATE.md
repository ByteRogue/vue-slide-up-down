This project is currently considered feature complete. I will probably not accept new features.

If you create a Pull Request, DO NOT CHANGE FORMATTING. Make your diffs as small as possible. 

DO NOT 
- change indentation
- add semicolons
- change whitespace
- run Prettier over everything
- add a linter
- `npm install` anything
- change lines that have nothing to do with your PR
- change the order of methods in the `slide-up-down.js` file

If you do any of the above (or anything similar), I will immediately reject the PR.
